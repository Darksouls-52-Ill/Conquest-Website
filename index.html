            <div class="resume-item pb-0">
              <h4>Conquest</h4>
              <h5>What Is Conquest?</h5>
              <p>
                There is two factions, the Allied Nations (Headquarters and spawn location at the Krasnostav Airfield)
                and the Chernarussian Movement of the Red Star, its Headquarters located at the North-West Airfield.
                This being loosely based off of the Civil War Chernarus lore, the server being set around 2009.<br>

                There are two spawn points, both at either one of the two faction bases. Your spawn determines which
                faction you will be a part of for your characters present life. You can gear up, squad up (or go
                solo), grab a vehicle and head out.<br>

                The objective is simple, after all this is a PvP server. Kill the opposing factions members. There are
                no rules of engagement, just engage as you would on any other PvP server. It then just becomes a
                repeated cycle. You may camp at the enemy Headquarters but you may not kill fresh spawns until they
                have acquired their military equipment; or unless they run from spawn.<br>

                Custom Armory, Mess-Hall, Infirmary and Car Yard<br>
                I have developed custom automatic spawns for military equipment when you enter the armory just off of
                the spawn point. Everything in this room will automatically respawn either within 10-20seconds once
                picked up and SeaChests with ammo will respawn every 10 minutes to ensure that no one is left without
                goodies.<br>

                The mess-hall is where you will be able to stock yourselves up with plenty of food and water. There
                will be taloon bags as well as dry sacks full of food items for your journey. Everything here
                automatically respawns once picked up.<br>

                The infirmary is where you will be able to supply yourself with all your medical needs. Make sure to
                stock up on bandages, epi-pens and tetracycline. <br>

                The Car Yard is the last place you will see before exiting your faction's respective Headquarters.
                These vehicles will have the essentials for surviving spawned inside their cargo and each vehicle will
                automatically respawn once the previous one has been driven away.<br>

                What do I do once I’ve spawned in?<br>
                You will spawn inside of the faction Headquarters. The hangar in front of you is the armory - gear up
                and then head either outback toward the medical tents for bandages, epi-pens, tetracycline etc; or
                head through the building toward the Mess-hall. Here you will be able to loot up on food, sodas,
                canteens and everything that you will need to survive while on the road.<br>

                The final stop before you exit the faction Headquarters is the Car Yard. You can grab a car and head
                off on your adventure. Each car will have essentials spawned within its cargo.<br>

                What can I do once I've left the Headquarters?
                Anything; provided it doesn’t conflict with the <br>few rules we have. You can set up a roadblock on
                the populated roads between the two Headquarters, you can grab a rifle, find a nice quiet spot and
                pick people off as they enter your vicinity. This is a two group faction PvP server. You can leave
                your team and go solo or you can squad up with people from your faction and eliminate the opposing
                enemies. It’s up to you!<br>

            <h3 id="rules1" class="resume-title">Rules</h3>
            <div id="rules1" class="resume-item">
              <h5>Rules Set For Ingame Incounters.</h5>
              <p>MAKE SURE YOU ARE FULLY AWARE OF THE RULES BEFORE LOGGING INTO CONQUEST.<br>
                <br>
                Do not ruin the integrity, or experience of the game mode for other users.<br>
                • Do not mess with people at HQ, it more often than not causes issues. (Yes this means not force-feeding
                people gasoline, amongst other egghead moves.)<br>
                <br>
                PVP<br>
                • You are NOT allowed to team kill.<br>
                • No spawn killing.<br>
                • It is ILLEGAL to kill a member of your team, even if they ask you to kill them.<br>
                • You cannot kill anyone inside of the SafeZone radius (This goes for both sides, there is no combat in
                this radius) (This means no shooting into, or shooting out of the SafeZone)<br>
                <br>
                HEADQUARTERS<br>
                • Do not drive vehicles inside of the HQ hangars.<br>
                • Do not enter the radius of the other factions SafeZone.<br>
                • If you want to suicide to get to the other faction. Please do it in the dedicated areas at each HQ
                with the knives, not guns.<br>
                • SafeZone border is a hard-border, this means you cannot shoot into it. You can clearly see the
                outlines in the maps on the discord.<br>
                • No shooting in the Headquarters. (Especially the targets at the Red Star HQ on Livonia).<br>
                <br>
                OUTPOSTS<br>
                • If your faction captures an outpost, you should hoist your factions flag.<br>
                • Do not intentionally put the opposing faction flag up to lure in the other team.<br>
                Flags depicted below<br>
                <br>
                UNIFORM<br>
                • You MUST wear your armband and uniform. (You can disregard your helmet if you so please).<br>
                • There are only two factions, do not take off your uniform or identifier and pretend to be another
                group.<br>
                • You are not allowed to swap armbands or uniforms off of a dead player of the opposing faction.<br>
                <br>
                ETIQUETTE<br>
                • Do not go around and steal wheels off of vehicles, do not remove the batteries, do not remove the
                spark-plugs, do not remove the radiators.<br>
                • You are not allowed to use any form of exploit or bug, or break DayZ Terms of Service.<br>
                • Don’t be toxic. We’re just trying to relieve some stress and have some fun.<br>
                • Do not take more than you need from the HQ's. Restock zones exist for a reason.<br>
                • Do not litter the HQ's with your dropped loot. Try to keep it in one area (it does have a despawn
                timer that I've set, destroyed items despawn the quickest).<br>
                • No unnecessary shooting inside the HQ or overusing VOIP. This is to help decrease crashes and
                bluescreens.<br>
                • You are not allowed to impersonate the other group over VOIP.<br>
                • Do not switch between the faction channels to spy on what the other team is doing.<br>
                • No colluding with members of the other faction.</p>
